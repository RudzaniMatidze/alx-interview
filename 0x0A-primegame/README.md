# 0x0A-primegame

## Description
For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

### Concepts Needed:

<b>1.Prime Numbers:</b>
- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

<b>2.Sieve of Eratosthenes:</b>
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

<b>3.Game Theory:</b>
- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

<b>4.Dynamic Programming/Memoization:</b>
- Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

<b>5.Python Programming:</b>
- Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
- Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
