# 0x09-island_perimeter

## Description:

For the “0. Island Perimeter” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

## Concepts Needed:

<b>1. 2D Arrays (Matrices):</b>

- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
- Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

<b>2. Conditional Logic:</b>

- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

<b>3. Counting Techniques:</b>

- Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

<b>4. Problem-Solving Strategies:</b>

- Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

<b>Python Programming:</b>

- Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
