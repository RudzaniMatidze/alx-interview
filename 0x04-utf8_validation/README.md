# 0x04-utf8_validation

For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

## Concepts Needed:
<b>1.Bitwise Operations in Python:</b>
- Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
- Python Bitwise Operators

<b>2.UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:</b>
- Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
- Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
- UTF-8 Wikipedia
- Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
- The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets

<b>3.Data Representation:</b>
- How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
- Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

<b>4.List Manipulation in Python:</b>
- Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
- Python Lists

<b>5.Boolean Logic:</b>
- Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
