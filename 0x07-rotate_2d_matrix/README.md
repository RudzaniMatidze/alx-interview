# 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix

## Description:
For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

### Concepts Needed:
<b>1.Matrix Representation in Python:</b>
- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
<b>2.In-place Operations:</b>
- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
<b>3.Matrix Transposition:</b>
- Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
<b>4.Reversing Rows in a Matrix:</b>
- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
<b>5.Nested Loops:</b>
- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
- Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
