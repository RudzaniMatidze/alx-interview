# 0x03-log_parsing

For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

### Concepts Needed:
<b>1.File I/O in Python:</b>
+ Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
+ Python Input and Output

<b>2.Signal Handling in Python:</b>
+ Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
+ Python Signal Handling

<b>3.Data Processing:</b>
+ Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
+ Aggregating data to compute summaries.

<b>4.Regular Expressions:</b>
+ Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
+ Python Regular Expressions

<b>5.Dictionaries in Python:</b>
+ Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
+ Python Dictionaries

<b>6.Exception Handling:</b>
+ Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
+ Python Exceptions
By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
